<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />To: Database Consultant<br />From: City Jail Information Director<br />Subject: Establishing a Crime-Tracking Database System</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />It was a pleasure meeting with you last week. I look forward to working with your company to create<br />a much-needed crime-tracking system. As you requested, our project group has outlined the<br />crime-tracking data needs we anticipate. Our goal is to simplify the process of tracking criminal<br />activity and provide a more efficient mechanism for data analysis and reporting. Please review the<br />data needs outlined below and contact me with any questions.<br />Criminals: name, address, phone number, violent offender status (yes/no), probation status<br />(yes/no), and aliases<br />Crimes: classification (felony, misdemeanor, other), date charged, appeal status (closed, can<br />appeal, in appeal), hearing date, appeal cutoff date (always 60 days after the hearing date), arresting<br />officers (can be more than one officer), crime codes (such as burglary, forgery, assault;<br />hundreds of codes exist), amount of fine, court fee, amount paid, payment due date, and charge<br />status (pending, guilty, not guilty)<br />Sentencing: start date, end date, number of violations (such as not reporting to probation officer),<br />and type of sentence ( jail period, house arrest, probation)<br />Appeals: appeal filing date, appeal hearing date, status (pending, approved, and disapproved)<br />Note: Each crime case can be appealed up to three times.<br />Police officers: name, precinct, badge number, phone contact, status (active/inactive)<br />Additional notes:<br />&bull; A single crime can involve multiple crime charges, such as burglary and assault.<br />&bull; Criminals can be assigned multiple sentences. For example, a criminal might be<br />required to serve a jail sentence followed by a period of probation.</span></p>
